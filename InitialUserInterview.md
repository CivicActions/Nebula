# Initial User Interview

On Wednesday June 17th, we had a phone interivew with Martha Ogilvie, PhD (Director, Intellectual Property Management, Office of Technology Development, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center).

She actually reviewed our Trello board and stories.

She confirmed:

* An ability to compare the adverse effects of two (potentially hypothetical) regimes is very valuable.
* Geriatric management, including the ability to maintain and share securely, drug regimes, is very valuable.
* She questions the value of the data if not normalized (Owen has researched partial normalization with AHQR data).
* She believes any tool that saves time for busy doctors is very likely to help underserved areas.
* She believes seeing the adverse events is a valuable starting point, but that doctors will not follow it blindly.
* Doctors want to be able to play with drug regimes.
* Interacting with Medicare and Medicaid supported medicines could be very valuable.
