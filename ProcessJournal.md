# Journal of our Meetings and Ceremony

On Wednesday morning, we had a Sprint Planning Meeting with approximately 10 people, including CEO and VP of sales.

In this meeting, ideation meeting was planned, and users identified willing to help with Human Centered Design. We agreed to explore two possibilities:

* Consider a research tool for professionals as examplified by Martha, PhD biologist
* Consider a tool for the public-at-large.

We began studying the data sets as a prelude to Ideation and Story writing meeting.
