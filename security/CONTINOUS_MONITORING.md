# Continuous Monitoring

> Continuous Monitoring is a risk management approach to cybersecurity that maintains an accurate picture of an agencyâ€™s security risk posture, provides visibility into assets, and leverages use of automated data feeds to quantify risk, ensure effectiveness of security controls, and implement prioritized remedies. - [https://cio.gov/protect/continuous-monitoring](https://cio.gov/protect/continuous-monitoring/)

## Summary
CivicActions has validated the deployment of the nebula application in a configuration that includes continuous monitoring. 

This configuration includes:
* deploying the application onto 18F's FISMA-READY Ubuntu LTS (See: https://github.com/fisma-ready/ubuntu-lts)
* automated scanning with SCAP
* identification of vulnerability feeds
* monitoring of server status

The purpose of this document is to provide evidence of integrating security and continuous monitoring into the agile delivery of IT services. 

## 18F's FISMA-READY Ubuntu LTS 
[18F's FISMA-READY Ubuntu LTS](https://github.com/fisma-ready/ubuntu-lts), provides guidance for a "hardened, FISMA Ready Ubuntu LTS Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs) that are suitable for use in Amazon Web Services (AWS)" that "inherit AWS controls assessed by the FedRAMP program" when instantitated in AWS's  US-East or US-West regions.

We cloned the FISMA-Ready LTS Ubuntu repository and ran the `ami.sh` script to generate the publicly available FISMA-Ready LTS Ubuntu 14.04 AMI (`ami-b7393887`) in AWS region `us-west-2`.

We then validated our automated deployment worked using the FISMA-Ready LTS Ubuntu AMI `ami-b7393887` instead of the default Docker Ubuntu 14.04 AMI (`ami-7f675e4f`) by setting AWS environmental variables during deployment:
```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
export AWS_AMI=ami-b7393887
export AWS_ROOT_SIZE=30
```

## Automated Scanning with SCAP
To automate scanning of operating system configuration we used GovReady Ubuntu 14.04 SCAP (see: https://github.com/GovReady/scap-fisma-ready-ubuntu-lts) content and JOVAL's Professional scanner. 

#### NOTE on Ubuntu and Docker SCAP
GovReady Ubuntu 14.04 SCAP is the first open source SCAP content for Ubuntu and was developed specifically to test FISMA-Ready Ubuntu LTS. The FISMA-Ready SCAP contains OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language) schema currently being reviewed by OVAL board and can only be tested with a special version of JOVAL's Professional scanner.)

## Identification of Vulnerability Feeds

| Vulnerability Feed | RSS Version|
|--------------------|------------|
|https://alas.aws.amazon.com | https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas.rss |
|http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/ | http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/rss.xml |
|http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13534/product_id-28125/Docker-Docker.html| -- |

## Monitoring of Server Status
We installed https://www.runscope.com a service to continously monitor and test our APIs.
