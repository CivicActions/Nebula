And our [api](https://nebulaapi.civicactions.com/) will someday be useful, but is not 
ready now.

This is our application to 18F's Agile BPA RFQ.  However, it is all freely sharable, and we aim to make a product 
truly valuable. Feel free to fork this code.

# Process [DRAFT SO FAR]

CivicActions has developed a functional, responsive, mobile-friendly web app using Agile, Lean, and Human-Centered Design Methodologies.

Our development process has been SCRUM. We used a two-sprint process, with each sprint lasting 4 days.

We mustered a team with diverse skills on the first day. We immediately scheduled an interview with an actual user, Dr. Martha Ogilvie of NIH, for the afternoon of the first day. Prior to the interview, we had an ideation session. We wrote candidate stories and performed a JK exercise.

Martha validated our approach and helped us reprioritize our stories. We began work on several “spikes” and an MVP.

Day 2 we had more story-writing, backlog grooming, and estimation---the standard SCRUM “ceremony”---as input to a Design Studio, run by our on-staff HCD expert.

Began work on deployment, wireframes, spiking the API, and continued work on the MVP.

We opened our repository to the public, and published our guide to what we thought 18F was looking for. We continued following the USDS Playbook checklist and documenting our accomplishments.

We chose a product owner and had the MVP working (though buggy). 

Day 3 we had our second interview based on MVP. Adjust GUI design based on her feedback.

Day 4 we met with Tyson Kamikawa of Harvard Medical School. He further tuned our thinking. We performed the “comparative value” exercise with him. We held a meeting with designated Legal, Security, and Privacy officers. Successfully planned eliminating PII while maintaining functionality.

Day 5 Had Retrospective for first sprint. Computed velocity. Planned Second Sprint.
