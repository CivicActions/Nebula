# Second Interview with Dr. Martha Ogilvie

## Video

We recorded this interview with BlueJeans, hopefully we will get that online and link to it here.

## Notes

Martha helped us understand the difference between two personae:

* Caregiver persona: wants to understand all adverse event possiblities
* Consumer persona: tends to be focused on specific symptoms which they are experiencing.

If the first is worth $100, Martha believed the second is worth $60.

So as a baseline we define show all adverse events for a drug regime as the "Caregiver" app and say it is worth $100.

When then considered changing the vertical scale of the planned chart from "absolute events" to "events per usage", Martha said that would make the Caregiver app worth $200.
