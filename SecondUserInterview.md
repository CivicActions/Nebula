# Second Interview with Dr. Martha Ogilvie

## Video

We recorded this interview with BlueJeans, hopefully we will get that online and link to it here.

## Notes

Martha helped us understand the difference between two personae:

* Caregiver persona: wants to understand all adverse event possiblities
* Consumer persona: tends to be focused on specific symptoms which they are experiencing.

If the first is worth $100, Martha believed the second is worth $60.
