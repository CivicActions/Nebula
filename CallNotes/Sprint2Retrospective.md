# What we did well....

- Cooperation was very effective, team hitting on all cylinders
- Cooperation with design was particularly effective
- Separate repo for design was great 
- Daily scrum
- All accessible via slack 
- User review nicely staggered 
- Fluidity okay
- Very short sprints additve to our process (Good)


# What we did poorly....

- QA effort - could have used more guidance 
- Velocity is tough to manage - hours fluctuate day to day - tough to track
- Estimates hard to follow
- Work-life balance violated in some cases
- Tracking budget



# What we should change

- Are going to become more specific and conservative with testing and attention
- More formal velocity burn chart
