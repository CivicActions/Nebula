### Team balance scores:
In keeping with a central tenet of our process standards at CivicActions, we track "work/life" balance on each call. Tracking of this in github begins with our 6/24 scrum.
ET: 8; RA: 8; DN: 8.5; SC: 8.5; RR: 9.5; HP: 9; AR: 6; AP: 8

### Resolutions from this meeting:
* Ron agreed to do QA, particularly around Mobile devices.
* Rob to start Checklist for Thursday night
* We generally agreed to treat announcement that GSA had extended the deadline as a non-event and just complete all of our work by Thursday night as originally planned.
* We agreed to an approach about accessibility, based on text and visual impairment (a light investment, given our time.)
