# Sprint 3 Retrospective (July 2nd)

## What we did well

+ Responded well to stressful extensions
+ Reviewed bid requirements (and changes) effectively
+ Dealing with strong criteria as well
+ Managed energy level effectively
+ Made compromises between between UI design and Engineering possibilities
+ Github issue prioritiztion was very effective
+ Luke/Ron cooperation via GitHub very effectively
+ Velocity increased (conceptually)
+ Continuous deployment very effective at quick turn around on live site
+ Good cooperion on wireframes
+ Smooth rhythm
+ Worked in parallel effectively
+ User interviews with Martha and Tyson very effective.
+ UX/UI people involved early in the process

## What we did poorly

- Too many regressions, could have saved time by more specific testing before every commit
- No automated tests for the front end (thought we had them for the back end.)
- Front end process could have been better thought out.
- Could have involved UX people EVEN earlier
- Did not prepare well for the likely eventuality fo the extension
- Mental energies not kept up well in face of the extension

## What we will change if we have a Sprint 4

* Set expectations better for code freezes, talk more about overall timeframe
* Involve security and other single points of dependence smoothly throughout project
* More accessibility review and thought early in the project
* Need to manage inevitable staffing disruptions more effectively.
