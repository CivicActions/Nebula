Internal Demo and Legal Q&A, 6/22

Henry Poole, Owen Barton, Ethan Teague, Rob Read, Greg Elin, Steve Curtis 

Call began with demo of working prototype by Ethan. 

Q&A: 
HP: Drug data stored anywhere? 
ET: No. Real time call to API. 
- At present, no association between patient and this data
- If user chooses to record a particular url to capture a particular search, that's their own choice, undertaken at own risk
HP: Also need to make sure to state that API is not for clinical use. 
OB: Notification re: proper use of data. 

HP: What is logged by our system? IP address of user? 
OB: Nginx is logging IP address, url, browser ID. 
- These are all totally standard for every site on the web
HP: Not logging referral? Can we check? 
OB: Yes, log referrer as well
- Query is captured as well in path, unless we use Post instead 
HP: Query is captured and saved, associated with IP address? 
OB: Yes 
GE: IP addresses generally regarded as not personally identifiable
- IP address + other info could be considered triangulate-able 
- A good idea, eg, to use https 
OB: We will be using https 
- Risk is equivalent, eg, to googling "aspirin" or "ibuprofen" 

HP: Using fedramp? 
OB: Yes. Hosting with AWS - everything in US is fedramp, therefore 
- Nothing on top of that, however 

HP: Keeping track of all software we're using, keeping track of all licensing? 
OB: All licenses being tracked in github
ET: Have added jquery - will add to doc
OB: Adding licenses for each top level php item
HP: Contributions from outside in repo? 
- Would need to get copyright declaration from anyone contributing
- License of assignment for each - Need to be alerted
OB: Nothing to date outside of user input 

RR: Nothing can be brought into repo until we decide to merge it 
GE: Would have to say that it's wonderful to have working code on a Monday 

GE: Have we identified enhancements? 
RR: Have asked for recommendations from users, and have evaluated them for "value" with users 
- Some are likely in scope for this MVP, and some not

HP: Looking at features and scope 
- Looking at these all in terms of a timeline - does not matter as much in terms of where we'll be on Friday 
- This week's exercise is around process
