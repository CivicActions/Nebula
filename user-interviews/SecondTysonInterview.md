# Inteview with Tyson

New GUI is good. 

A number of bugs noted:
* Enter key not working 
* Type ahead doesn't work well
* Initial colors are too light and poorly separated

Tyson reiterated his call for:

* Having the Drug Code
* Having a short descriptiong of the Drugs

The two major things he wanted were:

* Dosage information
* Number of prescriptions.

He said if we could get number of prescriptions, product would become 4 times more useful.  We imemediately prioritized working on that (it was underway.)
