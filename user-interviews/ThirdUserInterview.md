On Monday afternoon we interviewed P. Tyson Kamikawa, 
Director of Shared Platforms and IT Effectiveness at Harvard Medical School.

The video of this interview will be place here [TBD].

Tyson basically confirmed the value of our approach for the "Caregiver" audience.  We
performed a value exercize with him of various features, and here is his input:

- $100 -- Basic "Caregiver" functionality, ability to see absolute number of adverse events
for a drug regimen
- $300 -- Abilty to see adverse events as a probability of usage (we believe this can be approximated with the AHRQ data)
- $200 -- Warming of incompatible drug regimen
- $200 -- "Blink chart" ability to easily compare multiple drug regimens
- $100 -- Print out reports for patients
- $100 -- Ability to compare severity

Although we did not get a dollar value for it, Tyson also wants a short description of the
drug family on the screen to avoid confusion of the drug name.  Addtionally, he suggested
knowing a set of drugs in the same family would be very valuable (Ron had already planned this.)

Tyson seemed to generally agree a goog architecture would be to provide a way for the
information to NOT be associated with Patient information in our system, but to preserve
a URL that could be saved and kept in the doctor's own Patient Information System if they choose to do so.
