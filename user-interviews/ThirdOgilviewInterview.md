# On Day 7, had third interview with Martha Ogilvie, PhD

[Link to video] (https://youtu.be/CRA1zJ2wJUE) 

Martha noted the following things:
* Speed good
* Used well in IPad
* Use on laptop and desktop as well

She had several problems:
* She tried to enter many drug names (space separated) and that got rather consuing.
* Enterring altogether made colors confusing

She said we could easily making an improvment by adding text that explains:
"What is the story behind this?"
That alone could make a good improvement.

She also noted:
* "Drug Ineffective" is often reported and not very useful, suggested treating specially.
* She wanted to know about over-the-counter usages
* She wanted footnotes at the bottom of the page explaining the MEPS/ARHQ data
* She wanted to see a small definition of the side effect if you hover over it.

She said, that if the current system is worth $100, then having the "pie chart" is worth $250.

She additionally wanted to see:
Synergists
Antagonists
Drug Synonyms

She agreed portable URL is a valuable feature.

She said that if we get the Pie Chart of Prescriptions working, we should try to get more doctors to "test drive" it.

To valuable use cases for those testers are:
* When patients presents symptoms, want to see the regimen
* When considering adding a drug to the regimen, see the effects.
