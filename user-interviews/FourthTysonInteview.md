# Fourth Interview with Tyson

Tyson believes it looks much better.  He believes we are right on the borderline of having something valuable now.

He suggested several major bug fixes/changes:

* He wants to see all drugs, even if it is not in the AHRQ database.  We have to have a way to make it visible that it is not 
in the AHRQ data.
* Multiple drug names don't work.
* Poison control numbers etc. are for the US only
* He suggested the title: "Comparative Prescription Volume"
* He suggested removing numbers entirely from Pie Chart
# Suggested "Total Reported Adverse Events"

He generally confirmed what we were doing and our direction.
