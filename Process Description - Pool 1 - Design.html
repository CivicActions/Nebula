We used a SCRUM development process that consisted of the following two sprints:</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">First Sprint</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On the first day, we mustered a multidisciplinary MVP team that consisted of four developers, a product owner, a product manager, a designer, a UX expert, a style guide designer, and a writer. Our product owner, Rob Read, was responsible for ensuring project success and satisfying deliverable requirements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In order to pinpoint user needs from the outset, we immediately scheduled an </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCivicActions%2Fnebula%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fuser-interviews%2FInitialUserInterview.md&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG93trQaDRVkjnFyuYLUnG5CAWPdA">interview</a></span><span>&nbsp;with an actual user, Dr. Martha Ogilvie of NIH, who agreed to test the product. Prior to the interview, we conducted an ideation session to proactively brainstorm possible requirements and solutions, which included candidate stories and a prioritization exercise. Dr. Ogilvie validated our approach and helped us reprioritize our stories. Utilizing her feedback, we worked on several &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; to identify risks and uncertainties. </span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>During Day Two, we dove deeper into story-writing, backlog grooming, and </span><span>estimation</span><span>&nbsp;-- all channeled into a Design Studio, run by our on-staff HCD expert. Using the best ideas, we began working on MVP deployment, wireframes, and spiking the API. We decided to utilize </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chartjs.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdbWk7h9J34dfFq3czHGrZEP2D1w">Chart.js</a></span><span>&nbsp;as a powerful open-source tool to convey graphical adverse drug effect data to the user, and </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fjquery.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwHug0a3dAQeHj3gBsPltK-jTsaQ">JQuery</a></span><span>&nbsp;as a simple input tool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Adhering to &ldquo;Open First&rdquo; principles, we opened our repository to the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCivicActions%2Fnebula%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FDEVOPS_MANUAL.md&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPjHq1uSepRugde2gLv4tyhEXQ7Q">public</a></span><span>, explaining how to install, reuse and build upon our code. Following the USDS Playbook checklist, we documented our accomplishments and adjusted our product according to user feedback. By this stage of our process, we had a workable MVP to improve upon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On Day Three we held our </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCivicActions%2Fnebula%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fuser-interviews%2FSecondUserInterview.md&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmhUigYkRoMxhcD5hufPXf6j5BxA">second interview</a></span><span>&nbsp;with Dr. Ogilvie to discuss the MVP. We adjusted our General User Interface (GUI) design based on her feedback. A crucial discovery was the need to make the product more intuitive and easy to navigate for busy doctors, which we accomplished by normalizing the data. We extended our back-end API to include this capability and began a spike to join the data with AHRQ data for added value. We utilized Silex and Guzzle for the back-end, and PHPUnit as a simple automated testing framework. We used Jenkins as a Continuous Integration toolkit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On Day Four we met with Tyson Kamikawa of Harvard Medical School for a &ldquo;comparative value&rdquo; exercise to fine-tune our process. We also met with designated legal, security, and privacy officers, and worked on eliminating Personally Identifying Information by using &ldquo;portable URLs&rdquo; to conveniently avoid storing PII while maintaining the functionality and usefulness of the product.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Second Sprint</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Day Five began with a retrospective for the first sprint, followed by story-writing and prioritizing based on user interviews. We decided to write a small style guide for our super-simple application, using the </span><span class="c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.18f.gov%2Fguides-template%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNTAarJY2Y24N8YFk2tJSBX1qfrw">18F style guides</a></span><span>&nbsp;as a foundation. Our Operations Engineer fully vetted our deployment time using &ldquo;immutable infrastructure&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Seeking offline feedback from our external users, we published the URL to our working MVP and asked the users to review the product before their next interviews to allow for the most effective feedback. Throughout our process, we used a limited form of the Lean UX methodology, attempting to verify each assertion with our test users.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We rapidly addressed a few bugs that our Quality </span><span>Assurance</span><span>&nbsp;process uncovered. We also iterated through a number of wireframes, producing several versions to ensure a stellar user experience.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>One story that we identified and prioritized was to switch to &ldquo;horizontal stacked bar charts&rdquo; as a more informative and natural visual representation. This required a rapid change to </span><span>Google Graphs </span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" name="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span>as an alternative to Chart.js. We nimbly made the switch and found that it enabled a more user-friendly way to present data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>To ensure mobile responsiveness, we shifted to a chart of horizontal bars, so that any number of adverse drug events can be displayed by scrolling, even on a mobile device. We achieved this by leveraging Bootstrap.js. Out-of-the-box styling is available with Bootstrap, but we customized this slightly to match the 18F styling.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" name="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;To assist the visually </span><span>impaired</span><span>&nbsp;and satisfy accessibility standards, we utilized a color palette which is easily discernible even to the colorblind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On Day Six, we tied the back-end API to the front-end to provide normalization, making the data more consumable and readable. This was a major feature requested in our user interviews. Our engineers worked on automated tests for the back-end API. </span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We completed our process on Day Seven, polishing the application and ensuring that all RFQ deliverables had been met.</span></p><div class="c9"><p class="c8"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" name="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c6">Here it seems that Google Graphs were used for the horizontal bar charts, but in the paragraph below it talks about Bootstrap.
