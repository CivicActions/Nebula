Build the service using agile and iterative practices</span> (#98) - <i>AP</i><p>We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users’ hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Release features and improvements multiple times each month<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Use a source code version control system<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Use code reviews to ensure quality</p><div id="xrefDiv98"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">5. Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery</span> (#99) - <i>AP</i><p>To improve our chances of success when contracting out development work, we need to work with experienced budgeting and contracting officers. In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources.</p>

<p>The TechFAR Handbook provides a detailed explanation of the flexibilities in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that can help agencies implement this play.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like “pay-for-what-you-use” services<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan</p><div id="xrefDiv99"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">6. Assign one leader and hold that person accountable</span> (#100) - <i>AP</i><p>There must be a single product owner who has the authority and responsibility to assign tasks and work elements; make business, product, and technical decisions; and be accountable for the success or failure of the overall service. This product owner is ultimately responsible for how well the service meets needs of its users, which is how a service should be evaluated. The product owner is responsible for ensuring that features are built and managing the feature and bug backlogs.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> A product owner has been identified<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> All stakeholders agree that the product owner has the authority to assign tasks and make decisions about features and technical implementation details<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> The product owner has a product management background with technical experience to assess alternatives and weigh tradeoffs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> The product owner has a work plan that includes budget estimates and identifies funding sources<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> The product owner has a strong relationship with the contracting officer</p><div id="xrefDiv100"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">7. Bring in experienced teams</span> (#101) - <i>AP</i><p>We need talented people working in government who have experience creating modern digital services. This includes bringing in seasoned product managers, engineers, and designers. When outside help is needed, our teams should work with contracting officers who understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so our teams can be paired with contractors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services. The makeup and experience requirements of the team will vary depending on the scope of the project.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Member(s) of the team have experience building popular, high-traffic digital services<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Member(s) of the team have experience designing mobile and web applications<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Member(s) of the team have experience using automated testing frameworks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Member(s) of the team have experience with modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Member(s) of the team have experience securing digital services<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> A Federal contracting officer is on the internal team if a third party will be used for development work<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> A Federal budget officer is on the internal team or is a partner<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> The appropriate privacy, civil liberties, and/or legal advisor for the department or agency is a partner</p><div id="xrefDiv101"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">8. Choose a modern technology stack</span> (#102) - <i>AP</i><p>The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Consider open source software solutions at every layer of the stack</p><div id="xrefDiv102"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">9. Deploy in a flexible hosting environment</span> (#103) - <i>AP</i><p>Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes traffic and user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers that market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Resources are provisioned on demand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Resources scale based on real-time user demand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Resources are provisioned through an API<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Resources are available in multiple regions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> We only pay for resources we use<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Static assets are served through a content delivery network<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Application is hosted on commodity hardware</p><div id="xrefDiv103"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">10. Automate testing and deployments</span> (#104) - <i>AP</i><p>Today, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times a day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance are still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Run tests automatically as part of the build process<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Conduct load and performance tests at regular intervals, including before public launch</p><div id="xrefDiv104"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">11. Manage security and privacy through reusable processes</span> (#105) - <i>AP</i><p>Our digital services have to protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, how long it is kept, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.</p><p class="checklist">Checklist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> “Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[&nbsp;]</tt> Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable</p><div id="xrefDiv105"></div></div><div class="card-div "> <span class="card-title">12. Use data to drive decisions</span> (#106) - <i>AP</i><p>At every stage of a project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users.
