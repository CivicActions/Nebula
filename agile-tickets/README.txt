This directory is for daily updated static exports of our Trello agile board in json and html format.

The board itself is publicly available at https://trello.com/b/IlUoml5c/nebula and may also be used for convenient reference/search/filtering.

To update these files:
* Use Trello json export function to update json file. Rename to "trello.json".
* Use tool at http://connie-clark.github.io/print-trello/ to produce a HTML report by pasting in the json.
* Save the resulting page as "trello.html" - do not save the complete page, just HTML.
* Review and commit the results.
