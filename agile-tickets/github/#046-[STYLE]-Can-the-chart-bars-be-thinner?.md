The width of the chart bars is copious. Can they be made thinner? By half? 
*I thought we were going to show 10 side effects by default?* 
Thinner bars the user will be able to see more at once.

@ethanteague @rakanowicz Yes, we can find a way to make them thinner.  I don&apos;t see any reason to limit to 10---we moved to the horizontal bars to avoid such a limit.
