Dear Ron and Luke, 

Here are my recommendations for a survey:

* On a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is not like and 10 is extremely likely, how likely are you to recommend this tool to a colleague?

(This should be a selection between 1 and 10).

* What change would make you more likely to use this tool?

* If this tool were worth $100 to you, how much would it be worth with Drug Codes?

* If this tool was worth $100 to you, how much would it be worth with short Drug Descriptions?

* If this tool was worth $100 to you, how much would it be worth if it earmarked potential synergist and antagonists?

[The last 4 can be free-form text entry.  The first should should be long, and the last 3 short.)

@RobertLRead I just looked at Google Surveys and there&apos;s a cost to use (http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/pricing). There is a free version but I don&apos;t think it will suffice (http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/website_owners). The other option is to use Google Forms (https://docs.google.com/a/civicactions.com/forms/d/1U0ZdquvA7UipwseTutFYTJW4SF5Fo1Hb0tVpUhnOamw/edit).

I&apos;m :+1: with the latter unless you have a better solution.

Here what the Google form looks like:

http://civicactions.github.io/sideeffect.io/

It&apos;s not responsive, and I&apos;m not a big fan of the scroll within the embed. @aaronpava perhaps the other option?

Or have a fixed &apos;Take our user survey&apos; band/button on the bottom of the page that links to the form.

We also may want to consider some questions about the data presentation: 
- Are the data presented in the charts clear and understandable?
- Is there additional information you need to see in order to put the data in proper context?
