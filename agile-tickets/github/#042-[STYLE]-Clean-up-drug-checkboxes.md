Current spacing between checkbox and drug name is very tight. Add space between them. 

Capitalize drug names. Check font size of drug name (could be bigger). 

I&apos;m not opposed to the drug name being on top of the color bar. What Chuck suggests in his design do look nice and keep things on one line. If that&apos;s possible I&apos;d prefer the layout as described by Chuck. See image:
