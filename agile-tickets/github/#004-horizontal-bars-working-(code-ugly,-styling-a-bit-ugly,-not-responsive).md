Ethan, I this branch has horizontal stacked charts working using Google charts.  It is not quite as attractive as the vertical version---but I believe it could be styled.  It am not sure if it is &quot;responsive&quot; to resizing, or if our old code was.  Some googling suggest that to make it responsive we may have to invoke draw with an absolute number or something.

When I started this work it seemed like a good idea; but now I am not so sure.  Don&apos;t merge it until you have thought about it.  My goal was to let you work with April&apos;s backend primarily tomorrow---I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve achieved that, because we still have to some styling work (which I am very weak at, BTW) to make this better than what we have in the master branch.
