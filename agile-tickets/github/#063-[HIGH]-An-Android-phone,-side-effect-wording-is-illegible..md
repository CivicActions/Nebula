Possibly we can just give it more space overall.  The bar charts are needed only for comparison anyway.

Can we place the label above the bar:
Valium

I like on desktop how they are to the left; I wonder if they can &quot;responsively&quot; move to above the bar when viewed on tablet/mobile?

Ron, I&apos;ve cut down the bar width.  When you see it live you can decide to close this issue or we can try to make some other change.
