1. When searching for &quot;ADDERALL XR&quot; site gives &quot;Not enough columns given to draw the requested chart&quot; and does not display chart.

2. Also, when searching for &quot;XANAX&quot; first, site works as expected. Then adding additional &quot;ADDERALL XR&quot;  the circle graph displays, but bar chart is not updated with ADDERALL XP info. (Although no error message is reported.)

As of note: this bug was introduced within the last couple hours. Same test has been working successfully for last few days.
