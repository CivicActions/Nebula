@ethanteague Not sure how clear this will be, but it seems to work.

I&apos;ve significantly change the way we store the data in session Storage.  In taking it out I have to do more data manipulation---but I don&apos;t think it can be avoided to handle the problem that different drugs have different symptoms, and some may be completely missing a given symptom.
