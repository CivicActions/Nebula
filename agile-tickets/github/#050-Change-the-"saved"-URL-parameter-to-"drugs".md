These URLs would be more semantic.   

So instead of 
`/?saved=crestor+benicar+niaspan+aspirin` it would be `/?drugs=crestor+benicar+niaspan+aspirin`

If we make this change, we&apos;ll also want to adjust the Google Analytics Site Search setting (change from &quot;saved&quot; to &quot;drugs&quot;).
