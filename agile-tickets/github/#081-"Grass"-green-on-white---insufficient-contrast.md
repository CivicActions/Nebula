This is the green on the &quot;clear list&quot; and &quot;Link to this search&quot; text. This one we can resolve with a change from  #00A159 to something like #008348  or #008839. Any thoughts from a design perspective?

&quot;Link to this search&quot; should the the same as the new body text color: 5B5D60. &quot;clear list&quot; a link color should be hex color: 006689.
