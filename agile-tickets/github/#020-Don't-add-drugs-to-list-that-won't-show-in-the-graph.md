I added a drug to the list and got the following error message. The drug (aceon) is still in the list and checked, but does not show up in the graph. 

Tell me the name of the drug in the error message. 
If you want to show the drug in the list but not in the chart then uncheck it and make the checkbox disabled. Or don&apos;t show the checkbox and make the drug name red or highlighted somehow. 

But I&apos;d prefer not to see it in the list if it can&apos;t be in the chart.
