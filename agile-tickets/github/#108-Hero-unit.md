Suggest having just one line in the hero unit and moving the &apos;Enter drug name&apos; text into the search box. Keep it simple. Text above looks a little clunky. Also, if I click &apos;Compare&apos; with the default &apos;Tylenol,&apos; it doesn&apos;t do anything.

We need to have a field label for accessibility - assistive tech does not always expose the placeholder tech to users, in which case it is unclear what the field is for. We can visually hide the field label, however (which will leave it available to screen readers), as long as there is sufficient visual context for sighted users.

@grugnog does the text in the form field not address &quot;there is sufficient visual context for sighted users?&quot;
