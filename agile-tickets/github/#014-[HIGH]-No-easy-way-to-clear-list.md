There&apos;s no way to clear the list and start over with a new list. 
I had a &quot;clear&quot; link on the horizontal version but didn&apos;t transfer it to the vertical wire. Will update the wire.

added. Not sure where the wire frames were, so I came up with something. We can tweak if desired.
