The site doesn&apos;t appear truly responsive. The charts don&apos;t fit into the browser window properly and are cut off or using too little space. The page headings are not responsive and are being truncated. 

On the iPhone the site doesn&apos;t fill the browser:

The pie chart should float left so it can be seen in the window and not get cut off:

Seeing this, suggest removing the &apos;fork me&apos; ribbon.
