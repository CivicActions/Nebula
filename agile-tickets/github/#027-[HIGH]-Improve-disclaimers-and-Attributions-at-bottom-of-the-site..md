Henry pointed out that we should have two attributions:

Data provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (https://open.fda.gov)
Data provided by the Department of Health and Human Services (http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h152a/h152adoc.shtml)

Additionally, Martha suggested that we have better disclaimers/footnotes at the bottom of the page.  Tyson suggested a disclaimer at the Top of the page.  I suggest a thin disclaimer at the top of the page, with a link to the footnote at the bottom. The footnote at the bottom should explicitly call out the limitation/disclaimers of our data sources.

Not done yet. At the sprint planning meeting today it will likely be prioritized. It is a low-effort issue, I suspect it will be done by the early afternoon.

I have added the following text.  Once pushed, you will be able to see it on the live site.  I am happy to have Ron or Luke explain how to create a visual separation----if one is needed.  @hpoole @rakanowicz @lukefretwell 

Ron, if you think it is good, please close the issue as being done, or give me further advice.

That short paragraph bottom center- can it be moved to the first column? Those big blank spaces look odd. I&apos;d also love to see more space in the margins among the columns.
