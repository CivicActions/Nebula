The contrast on the &quot;compare&quot; button with the white text is too low for accessibility. I tried darkening the background from #3FA9F5  to #0B7ACA , but it ends up basically the same as the surround. Let me know what you would like to do - we could go with black text for that button, or we could make the button darker than the surround instead.

Yes, let&apos;s change the compare button background color to #404C54. Also, remove the blue border and change font to uppercase. @davenuman is this for you?
