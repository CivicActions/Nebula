Tommorow partners suggests changing name from &quot;Link to this search&quot; to &quot;Share this search&quot; --- seems like a good idea.

Not opposed to changing this, but let&apos;s think through it. If I see my Dr. using this app in his office with my drug regime how comfortable will I be seeing a &quot;share&quot; link? 
Perhaps something generic like &quot;Chart URL:&quot;  or Chart Link
