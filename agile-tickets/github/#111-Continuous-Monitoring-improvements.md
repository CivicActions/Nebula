This issue is for the improvement of continuous monitoring as per Question 32 in the [Technical QA](https://slack-files.com/files-pri-safe/T0297RSQF-F0724GP5Z/technical_questions_and_answers.pdf?c=1435762062-5f9ea13f77b3fdd4404a03bf837c39d3c159f028), which reads:

&gt;\32. Question: Would the Government please clarify what is meant &#x201C;continuous monitoring&#x201D;? Is it security monitoring or performance or both?

&gt;Answer: Continuous Monitoring, as used by the federal government (see, e.g., https://cio.gov/protect/continuous-monitoring/) refers to a &#x201C;risk management approach to cybersecurity that maintains an accurate picture of an agency&#x2019;s security risk posture, provides visibility into assets, and leverages use of automated data feeds to quantify risk, ensure effectiveness of security controls, and implement prioritized remedies.&#x201D;

The essential point here is &quot;provides visibility into assets&quot; and &quot;use of automated data feeds&quot;.

To demonstrate continuous monitoring, we created &quot;ami-b7393887&quot; in AWS region &quot;us-west-2&quot; using 18F&apos;s FISMA-READY Ubuntu-LTS to ensure our application deploys successfully on a host (e.g., server) automatically configured with security controls compatible with US Government baseline guidance.
