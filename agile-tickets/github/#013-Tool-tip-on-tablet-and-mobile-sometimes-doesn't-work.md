See video. For some reason I couldn&apos;t get the tooltip to popup on certain of the blue bars. 
Now that I&apos;m looking at it more closely, sometimes when I tapped on the bar it treated it like an image and made it a bit bigger (like it zoomed in a little bit) and then I could not longer click the bar. Not sure how the chart is being rendered. Can anyone else reproduce this?

This was reported on a very early build; seems to be working fine now.
