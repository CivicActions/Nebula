I think we can probably handle this by creating an error message.

@RobertLRead - can you give some more info about the iPad version, etc.? I&apos;m seeing charts on iPad.

Found another instance of this on Safari 6.2 http://app.crossbrowsertesting.com/public/i35a55d2674b1582/screenshots/z348fd254945a75ba540/zc3f7a6ac00fc876b30a

Low priority, but would be good to check session storage availability and display an error if it&apos;s not hard.
