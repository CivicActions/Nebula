Is it possible to remove the &quot;.io&quot; from the logo? So that it just reads [pill image] sideeffect

thoughts?

Luke and I discussed this and decided to keep the &quot;io&quot; because Side Effects is trademarked. So we&apos;re trying best to not jump on anyone&apos;s toes.

@halfstring I could add the padding, but are we sure that won&apos;t mess up the appearance on a phone?  I am loathe to tune things in Bootstrap unless we understand how they will effect the &quot;very small&quot; presentation.
