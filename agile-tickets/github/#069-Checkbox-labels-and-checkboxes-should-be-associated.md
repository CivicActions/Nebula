It&apos;s hard/impossible for assistive technology users to know which checkbox is which without this. Here is detail and reference markup:

Reopening this - the &quot;label for&quot; part was implemented, but the checkboxes were not given a name parameter, so the labels aren&apos;t actually connected with them. See http://webaim.org/techniques/forms/controls#checkbox for example markup.
