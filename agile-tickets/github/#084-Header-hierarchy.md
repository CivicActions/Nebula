This seems like a fairly low priority accessibility issue (and a fair amount of effort to resolve) - the headers are not bad in that the h3 and h4 cover decent levels of content, however they are don&apos;t capture a complete hierarchy. Ideally they should look more this, however:

* h1. SideEffect.io
* h3 headers should be h2s
* There should be a &quot;Sources and disclaimers&quot; or similar h2 header to wrap that information
* All the source/disclaimer h4 headers should then be h3

If we are using HTML5 sections, then the header hierarchy should restart from h1 inside each section.
