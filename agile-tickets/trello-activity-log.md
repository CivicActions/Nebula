As far as I can tell, the only thing remaining is a unit test checking retrieval. (There is a test that checks the site returns a 200 status)

@readrobert as of our demo / retro call today, this wasn't implemented. the sum (eg drug x + drug y + drug z) didn't consistently decrease left to right. has this user story since been met?

Going through this with my elder parents now. This would be very useful.

Weight the adverse events Reactions(symptoms) so the common symptoms bubble to the top of the symptoms list

Hmmmm why are they using the MedD standard which is a paid system :(
 Jun  18 at 5:50 AM
* Steve Wirt on An app that a doctor (or patient) could use prior to prescribing multiple drugs to validate if there are adverse effects with each other.
The data does not seem to support this kind of mapping. A drug has a flag of 'patient.drug.drugcharacterization' that has one entry for 3 = Interacting drug but there is nothing that I see that expressly says or connects drug A interacts with drug B.

Data mining of event aggregation could be done to bubble up some of these possibilities from the data, but they would be weak at best if the data is there.

This one seems pretty doable to me. Patient drug interactions are pretty well documented, and easy to grab from the fda json stream. https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/reference/ I can see us creating something nifty with chart.js (or another js lib) for this app.
