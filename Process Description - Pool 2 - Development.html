Our SCRUM development process consisted of the following two sprints:</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">First Sprint</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>On the first day, we mustered a multidisciplinary MVP team consisting of four developers, a product owner, a product manager, a designer, a UX expert, a style guide designer, and a writer. Our product owner was responsible for ensuring project success and satisfying deliverable requirements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>To quickly pinpoint user needs, we scheduled an </span><span class="c3"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCivicActions%2Fnebula%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fuser-interviews%2FInitialUserInterview.md&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG93trQaDRVkjnFyuYLUnG5CAWPdA">interview</a></span><span>&nbsp;with an actual user, Dr. Martha Ogilvie of NIH. Prior to the interview, we conducted an ideation session that included candidate stories and a prioritization exercise. Dr. Ogilvie validated our approach and helped us reprioritize our stories. We then worked on several &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; to identify risks and uncertainties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Day Two began with a Design Studio, run by our on-staff HCD expert. Using the best ideas, we began working on MVP deployment, wireframes, and spiking the API. We utilized </span><span class="c3"><a class="c1" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chartjs.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdbWk7h9J34dfFq3czHGrZEP2D1w">Chart.js</a></span><span>&nbsp;as a powerful open-source tool to convey graphical adverse drug effect data, and </span><span class="c3"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fjquery.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwHug0a3dAQeHj3gBsPltK-jTsaQ">JQuery</a></span><span>&nbsp;as a simple input tool. Adhering to &ldquo;Open First&rdquo; principles, we opened our repository to the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCivicActions%2Fnebula%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FUSER_MANUAL.md&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPjHq1uSepRugde2gLv4tyhEXQ7Q">public</a></span><span>, explaining how to install, reuse and build upon our code. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>On Day Three, we held our </span><span class="c3"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCivicActions%2Fnebula%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fuser-interviews%2FSecondUserInterview.md&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmhUigYkRoMxhcD5hufPXf6j5BxA">second interview</a></span><span>&nbsp;with Dr. Ogilvie to discuss the MVP, adjusting our Graphical User Interface (GUI) design based on her feedback. A crucial discovery was the need to make the product more intuitive and easy to navigate for busy doctors, which we accomplished by contextualizing the data. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Although we considered not having a back-end, we created one in response to the professional caregivers&rsquo; request to see adverse drug effects in context of the number of prescriptions. We utilized Silex and Guzzle for the back-end, and implemented a nascent unit test suite in PHPUnit, executed upon every GitHub check-in using Jenkins. We also designed our own API as a plug-compatible extension of the OpenFDA API, creating an open system for other firms or users to reuse and build upon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>We pinpointed a fundamental problem in the OpenFDA data -- it does not contain usage information and reports only the number of adverse events, making it difficult to compare the adverse effects of a drug that is widely used versus one that is lightly used. The back-end of our MVP solves this issue and adds value to the OpenFDA dataset by presenting an API that could, in some cases, produce a probability of adverse effect by correlating the data with the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c1" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmeps.ahrq.gov%2Fmepsweb%2Fdata_stats%2Fdownload_data%2Fpufs%2Fh152a%2Fh152adoc.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH22Sm2Fhs0WHyLsvW732xD-6YSIQ">AHRQ</a></span><span>&nbsp;data, which gives evidence as to the the total number of prescriptions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>On Day Four, we met with Tyson Kamikawa of Harvard Medical School for a &ldquo;comparative value&rdquo; exercise. We also met with designated legal, security, and privacy officers, and worked on eliminating Personally Identifying Information by using &ldquo;portable URLs&rdquo; to conveniently avoid storing PII while maintaining the functionality and usefulness of the product.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">Second Sprint</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Day Five began with a retrospective for the first sprint, followed by story-writing and prioritizing based on user interviews. We wrote a small style guide for our super-simple application, using the </span><span class="c3"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.18f.gov%2Fguides-template%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNTAarJY2Y24N8YFk2tJSBX1qfrw">18F style guides</a></span><span>&nbsp;as a foundation. Our Operations Engineer fully vetted our deployment time using &ldquo;immutable infrastructure&rdquo;. We quickly addressed a few bugs that our Quality Assurance process uncovered. We also decided to switch to &ldquo;horizontal stacked bar charts&rdquo; for a more user-friendly way to present the data, requiring a rapid change to Google Graphs as an alternative to Chart.js.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Seeking offline feedback from our external users, we published the URL to our working MVP and asked users to review the product before their next interviews. Throughout our process, we used a limited form of the Lean UX methodology, attempting to verify each assertion with our test users. Following the USDS Playbook checklist, we documented our accomplishments and iterated through several versions of our product to ensure the best user experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>On Day Six, we tied the back-end API to the front-end to provide prescription usage data in response to user feedback. Our engineers worked on automated tests for the back-end API. We refined our deployment and measured our total lead time (from code push through automated tests and production site updating) to be under 20 minutes. Front-end deployment consistently measures under six minutes, while the back-end deploys in less than 13 minutes (including dataset importing).</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>We completed our process on Day Seven, polishing the application and ensuring that all RFQ deliverables had been met.</span></p></body></html>
