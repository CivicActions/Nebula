# What we did poorly....

- Contact with Playbook checklist has slipped
- No professional writer so far
- No success metrics
- No public URL yet

# What we should change

- Lack of process about how to fully document things to close tickets/tasks [Put more effort into this.]
- Map our effort and budget into focus [Rob  and Steve to align understanding of budget/LOE deliverables.]
